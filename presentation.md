# Presentation: KNN Regression Model for Real-Estate Price Prediction

## 1. Introduction

**1.1 Context and Objective:** 
The real-estate market thrives on accurate price predictions. For an online real-estate platform, the ability to predict property prices accurately enhances user trust, attracts more clients, and enables better data-driven decision-making.

The project goal was to develop a reliable model for predicting property prices based on features like location, property characteristics and relevant external data, such as income statistics.

**1.2 Why KNN Regression?**
For this task the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model provides:

* **Simplicity:** KNN is a relatively straightforward algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity between data points.
* **Flexibility:** It works well for non-linear relationships, making it suitable for complex real-estate datasets.
* **Interpretability:** KNN's predictions can be directly traced back to the closest data points, making the decision-making process transparent and easy to explain.
* **Adaptability.** It allows for distance-weighted predicitons, which can capture localized variations in pricing effectively.

## 2. Dataset Analysis

**2.1 Overview of the Dataset**
The dataset contains current real-estate data, including features such as:

* Property Characteristics: Living area, property subtype, equipped kitchen, building condition, etc.
* Location: Latitude and longitude of the property.
* Additional Features: Minimum distance to major cities, communal average income.

**2.2 Feature Engineering**

* Categorical Encoding: Property types and building conditions were encoded numerically to make them compatible with the algorithm.
* Derived Features: Distances to major cities were computed to capture regional effects on pricing.
* Standardized Features: To ensure fair comparison across dimensions, continuous features (e.g., living area, latitude, longitude) were standardized.

**2.3 Dataset Challenges and Limitations**

* Imbalanced Distribution: Certain property types or locations may dominate the dataset, potentially biasing the model.
* Incomplete Data: Missing or inconsistent entries in features like condition or price could affect the modelâ€™s accuracy.
* Dynamic Market Trends: Real-estate prices fluctuate over time, making historical data potentially outdated.
