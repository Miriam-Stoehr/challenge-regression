Prepare the Immoweb presentation by investigating how your model works in details, its limits, its challenges, some tips and tricks you've found if any, if the model is a good fit for this specific price prediction,... try to make your model interpretable, it's easier for Decision Tree than neural networks but investigate this question in order to open a bit the model black box. Make sure you do all of this now because 2 weeks later you'll forget most of it. Investigate the limits of your dataset as well based on your ML experience.
