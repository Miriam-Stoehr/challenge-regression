# Evaluation Report

Content:

* a code snippet of the model instantiation (to see which model it is, what parameters,...)
* MAE (on training/test)
* RMSE (on training/test)
* R2 (on training/test)
* MAPE (on training/test)
* sMAPE (on training/test)
  
* The list of features you've used and how you got it (to quickly understand if you've done data leakage)
  
* Accuracy computing procedure (on a test set? What split %, 80/20, 90/10, 50/50? k-fold cross?)

* Efficiency (training and inference time). The fastest the best (sustainability).

* a quick presentation of the final dataset (how many records, did you merge some datasets together? did you scrape again? what cleaning step you've done, scaling, encoding, cross-validation.. No need of visuals, just bullet points)
